# Decentralized-Autonomous-Organization-Framework
This framework should help to build an own DAO with dedicated services and technologies like blockchains and a website for individual projects. This is an global project and everybody is invited to contribute.   

The goal is to have a modular system to setup an own hostable plattform with integrated ecosystem- and communication-technologies. This selfhosted DAO should be compatible (optional) in a global or local DAO-Network over generic APIs, so datas could be transfered between these plattforms. 

All these could be system-building scripts for recommended server-OS and tools, smartcontracts-templates in different programming-languages for various blockchains with VMs etc.
